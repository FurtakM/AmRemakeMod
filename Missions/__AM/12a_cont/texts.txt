// Dialogue 1 (when John reaches Roth)
$ D1-JMM-1
- Hello Peter. So how does it look? Is everything ready?
$ D1-Roth-1
- Sure. We have to hurry. Some of the people I tried to approach looked like they might want to spill news to Powell.
$ D1-JMM-2
- Great! What other good news do you bring?
$ D1-Roth-2
- We've made some important progress recently. We've developed special ammunition for snipers - it will put the target to sleep instead of killing him.
$ D1-JMM-3
- Good. I guess, we'd prefer to use it tonight.
$ D1-Roth-3
- We've also developed a new gizmo that will make all but invisible. Just look!
$ D1-JMM-4
- Hey, Peter?! What did you do? (he make a step forward and stumbles into Peter who becomes visible again)
$ D1-Roth-4
- See? You are completely invisible, until somebody stumbles into you. However, it has a drawback - you can't move or shoot or do anything else, while you are invisible, or you become visible again.
$ D1-JMM-5
- That's really impressive.
$ D1-Roth-5
- And one more thing. Take this. (John's profession changes to bazooker) This is something I've got from my colleagues in Russian camp. It's one of theirs space-shifting bazookas. I thought it might be helpful.
$ D1-JMM-6
- OK. So let's get going. I'll pick up the people I spoke with and we'll meet east of here, under that strange tree.

// Dialogue 2 (immediately afterwards)
$ D2-Pow-1
- Macmillan! I know you can hear me. I always knew there is some flaw within you, Macmillan, and I was right. It's pity, you would be a damned good soldier otherwise. I'm glad that this flaw gave up now and not when we would all rely upon you. But that doesn't mean I'll just let you go, Macmillan. You are a traitor and we shall deal with you like we deal with all traitors.
$ D2-JMM-1
- That's fine with me, general. I might be a traitor, but I'm not a butcher like you. I'm not going to send my men to their deaths only to please your pride anymore. This war is over, only you don't know it yet.
$ D2-Pow-2
- This is general Powell calling all units. Colonel Macmillan has betrayed our cause and defected to the enemy. All units are ordered to shoot him on sight.
$ D2-Joan-2
- [alive and $not selected] This can't be true, John?! Say something! Where are you going?

// Dialogue 3-Joan 
$ D3-Joan-Joan-1
- I don't know John... Are we doing the right thing?
$ D3-Joan-JMM-1
- The only right thing, honey. I want you to escape from this hell. We've had enough of this war.

// Dialogue 3-Bobby 
$ D3-Bobby-Bran-1
- I don't like it, commander, but I'll go with you. You have a point that this war is leading us nowhere. Besides, I reckon it's always better to fight on your side than against you.
$ D3-Bobby-JMM-1
- Glad to hear that, Bobby. I knew I could rely upon you.

// Dialogue 3-Cyrus 
$ D3-Cyrus-Cyr-1
- So the fucking war is over, ain't it, colonel? I don't know about joining fucking commies, though. Couldn't we just get out of it and tell the rest to go fuck themselves?
$ D3-Cyrus-JMM-1
- It ain't that easy. They won't let us just walk away. We'll need all the help we can get from the Russians that decided to join the Alliance.

// Dialogue 3-LisaJ (the player selected Joan to go with him or Joan already joined him (dialogue 4-Joan))
$ D3-LisaJ-Lisa-1
- So this is a final good bye?
$ D3-LisaJ-JMM-1
- What? Aren't you coming with me?
$ D3-LisaJ-Lisa-2
- I've thought about it and it just doesn't right. Desertion is a desertion by any other name.
$ D3-LisaJ-JMM-2
- I'm sorry to hear that. I'd rather have you on my side.
$ D3-LisaJ-Lisa-3
- Don't worry, John, I'm not gonna kill you... now.

// Dialogue 3-LisaL (Joan is dead or player left her in Alpha)
$ D3-LisaL-Lisa-1
- I never imagined I would run from combat one day.
$ D3-LisaL-JMM-1
- You aren't running away, Lisa. In fact, you've chosen the more difficult path.

// Dialogue 3-Frank (he should be sniper)
$ D3-Frank-Frank-1
- Hi, colonel. Where do you have the picnic basket?
$ D3-Frank-JMM-1
- Look, we've got something better. This is soporific ammo; it'll put the enemy to sleep - instantly.
$ D3-Frank-Frank-2
- Like, when you really want to enjoy killing him later on.

// Dialogue 3-Mark 
$ D3-Mark-Corn-1
- Hello, John. I haven't spent much time in this base, John, but I'm glad to be leaving. In fact, I spent maybe more time in Russian prison and I tell you, their commander and Powell here, they are two of a pair.
$ D3-Mark-JMM-1
- That's what I've heard from Peter as well. Well, I wonder how the commander of Alliance is going to be like.
$ D3-Mark-Corn-2
- What are you saying, Alliance commander? Just look into mirror, John.

// Dialogue 3-Tim 
$ D3-Tim-JMM-1
- I'm really glad you decided to go with us, Tim. You are more than a scientist you are an institution.
$ D3-Tim-Glad-1
- I don't know if I'm flattered by this, John. But I'm going all the same, I've seen enough here and I think that you guys have more of the future.

// Dialogue 3-Denis 
$ D3-Denis-Den-1
- It's really exciting, isn't it colonel? All those strange Artefacts that we'll be able to research now... I think this is the happiest day of my life.
$ D3-Denis-JMM-1
- We ain't quite there, yet, Denis. Take care; we are going to need you, once we get out of here.

// Dialogue 3-Yamako 
$ D3-Yamako-Yamoko-1
- You are a true hero to me, Macmillan-san. I'm ready to go with you.

// Dialogue 3-Gary 
$ D3-Gary-Grant-1
- I'm glad you want me to go with you, colonel. I'm fed up with this war just as anybody else.
$ D3-Gary-JMM-1
- Only some don't show it yet.

// Dialogue 3-Simms 
$ D3-Simms-Simms-1
- Good morning, colonel. Where is Peter?
$ D3-Simms-JMM-1
- He's in the car with the Artefact. Don't worry Susanne; I'll get you all out in one piece.

// Dialogue 4-Joan (this dialogue should take place if possible, if player didn't choose Joan to go with him)
$ D4-Joan-Joan-1
- John! John! How could you?
$ D4-Joan-JMM-1
- Joan. You've got to understand. I only wanted to keep you safe...
$ D4-Joan-Joan-2
- I don't give a damn about being safe. I want to be with you.
$ D4-Joan-JMM-2
- But it's just too dangerous! I don't want you to get involved.
$ D4-Joan-Joan-3
- Damn you, John Macmillan. I'm going with you, no matter what you say! (Joan joins the player's side.)

// Dialogue 4-Bobby 
$ D4-Bobby-Bran-1
- Colonel? Is it true?! I can't believe a man like you running away.
$ D4-Bobby-JMM-1
- We aren't running, Bobby. We just think there's better way how to end this war.
$ D4-Bobby-Bran-2
- I'll let you go, colonel, 'cause I owe you. But this makes us even; don't count on me any more.

// Dialogue 4-Cyrus 
$ D4-Cyrus-Cyr-1
- So where the fuck are you going, colonel? To build a fucking paradise? I'd rather stay with what I know, but I think everybody should where the fuck he wants. Go, colonel.
$ D4-Cyrus-JMM-1
- Thanks Cyrus.

// Dialogue 4-LisaJ (the player selected Joan to go with him)
$ D4-LisaJ-Lisa-1
- So rats are leaving the ship now? Oh my, I never thought you'll turn a coward, Macmillan.
$ D4-LisaJ-JMM-1
- Think what you want Lisa. Now let me go or take your gun.
$ D4-LisaJ-Lisa-2
- You can't never trust high brass, you simply can't. Get the fuck out of here, Macmillan, and if I ever see you again, I swear, I'm gonna kill you!

// Dialogue 4-LisaL (Joan is dead or player left her in Alpha and she didn't join him yet)
$ D4-LisaL-Lisa-1
- I never imagined you would run from combat one day, John. But I guess you know what you are doing. Pity, you didn't want to tell me. Now get the fuck out of here, before somebody spots you.

// Dialogue 4-Frank (he should be sniper)
$ D4-Frank-Frank-1
- Hi, colonel. So this is your last joke, isn't it?
$ D4-Frank-JMM-1
- It's no joke, Frank. We're leaving, there are much more interesting things to do here besides fighting for a mineral that nobody's gonna see for next two millions years.
$ D4-Frank-Frank-2
- You know what, colonel? You speak so incredibly funny, I think I'll just go with you. Powell is such a boring old fart; I don't think I could stand him now.
$ D4-Frank-JMM-2
- Welcome on board.

// Dialogue 4-Mark 
$ D4-Mark-Corn-1
- Hello, John. So you decided to go after all, I see.
$ D4-Mark-JMM-1
- Yeah, Mark, look, I'm sorry, but-
$ D4-Mark-Corn-2
- Never mind that, John. I can see your point. However, I'm staying here. I've got enough Russian hospitality for the rest of my life. Now, you should better get moving fast.

// Dialogue 4-Tim 
$ D4-Tim-JMM-1
- I'm sorry you didn't want to go with us, Tim. I think it would suit you.
$ D4-Tim-Glad-1
- I'm no great fan of general Powell, you know, but the man saved my life once and I can't simply leave him. Besides, John, it could be a good thing to have somebody who doesn't think you are a dastardly coward in this base, couldn't it? Pass my greetings to professor Gossudarov, I spoke with him over radio couple of time, seems like a sensible man.

// Dialogue 4-Yamako 
$ D4-Yamako-Yamoko-1
- You are a coward to me, Macmillan-san. I'm sorry, but I'll have to kill you. (starts shooting)

// Dialogue 4-Gary 
$ D4-Gary-Grant-1
- I'm sorry it ends like this, colonel. But I've got my orders. (starts shooting)

// Dialogue 5 (after they reach eastern spot of the map)
$ D5-JMM-1
- [little losses] Thank God, it seems we're out of the woods now. Or maybe, into the woods.
$ D5-JMM-1a
- [heavy losses] We paid dearly, but we made it.
