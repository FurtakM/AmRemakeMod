@ Moment of Vengeance
% The supplies and reinforcements the Americans need will never arrive. In their place ruthless terrorists are appearing instead, their motives unknown. The Americans must somehow turn the situation to their advantage.
& Gamma Base 3; September 29th, ERA + 1

// Dialogue 1 (after the start of the mission)
$ D1-Sol1-1
- (tiredly) Hey, who the hell... (Harrison gets out of vehicle) Excuse me, sir.
$ D1-Har-1
- Get me Macmillan. Now. (Macmillan comes)
$ D1-JMM-1
- What brings you here Ron?
$ D1-Har-2
- John. I've got a mission you're going to enjoy. These terrorists have been attacking the Russians as well as us. We've got intelligence they stormed several Russian bases in the South and the fighting isn't over.
$ D1-JMM-2
- Never thought they'd do us a favour.
$ D1-Har-3
- They have, and I want you to take advantage. The Russians are sending all the units they can to bolster the engaged force in the South. The Vanya base is almost defenceless. The Russian bases are going to be named after the great persons of Russian Communist party - e.g. L. D. Trotsky or S. M. Kirov. Of course, it may be possible for Americans to have different names for them.
$ D1-JMM-3
- But that's massive, and deep in their territory.
$ D1-Har-4
- Which is why they're not expecting anything to happen. This is the only chance we've had to get through the front line and make it count.
$ D1-JMM-4
- Who do you want me to take sir?
$ D1-Har-5
- The best soldiers Gamma and Delta have to offer. You'll also have superior kit.  I'm depending on you John. It's payback time. Shouldn't we change the name of the mission to "Payback time"?

# M1
Add Main warehouse
- Infiltrate the Russian base and destroy the main warehouse.
Add Secondary destroy
- Destroy as much of the base as possible.

# M1a
Out warehouse

// Dialogue 2 (a few moments after start of the mission)
$ D2-Har-1
- (over radio) John, this is Ron Harrison. Try to hit them hard and fast. You must be finished before the Russians get back. There is our scout in pine woods West from the road you came over. He should you give some intelligence on the Russian forces South.

// Dialogue 3a (meeting with Frank if he is alive. He is on a small clearing with an Apeman.)
$ D3a-Frank-1
- Damn, this is a left foot? You know which is left? This one! Remember this! You are a lady and you start with your left foot. Three, four...
$ D3a-Lisa-1
- [present: alt a1] Frank! That idiot. He is an embarrassment of the Army.
$ D3a-JMM-1
- [present: alt a2] Frank! Stop pestering that poor brute now!
$ D3a-Cyrus-1
- [present: alt a3] Heh, heh, look how they make a perfect pair!
$ D3a-Sol1-1
- [present: alt a4] I must be dreaming
$ D3a-FSol1-1
- [present: alt a5] This isn't possible!
$ D3a-Glad-1
- [present: alt a6] Hmmm... I always thought that there is something Apeman-like about Frank Forsyth.
$ D3a-Frank-2
- Wait, don't run, these are my friends! Damn, it's gone. Do you know how long it took me to...
$ D3a-JMM-2
- There is no time for such silliness. Frank. We need plans of South Russian base. Now.
$ D3a-Frank-3
- (reveals part of map) Sure, sir. Have a look here - there is string of fortifications. But there are almost no soldiers here: most of these turrets are probably automatic.
$ D3a-JMM-3
- Automatic? What do you mean.
$ D3a-Frank-4
- Well, I've thrown couple of those berries that stink so awfully, when you squeeze them, in one of those turrets and nothing happened.
$ D3a-Lisa-4
- [present] (ironically) Excellent. Just did it by the book.
$ D3a-JMM-4
- So the Russians have some new technology. How comes our scouts didn't find out?
$ D3a-Frank-5
- But they did, sir. Just now.
$ D3a-JMM-5
- It's quite unpleasant surprise. It should have been more or less unprotected.
$ D3a-Frank-6
- See the plans, without mobile units they're sitting ducks.

// Dialogue 3b (meeting with different scout when Frank is dead.)
$ D3b-Yam-1
- Sir? I'm Yamoko Kikuchi, I was scouting enemy bases South.
$ D3b-JMM-1
- What did you find?
$ D3b-Yam-2
- See the plans, without mobile units they're sitting ducks
$ D3b-JMM-2
- My God, so many fortifications. How many people they have? Are all these bunkers operational?
$ D3b-Yam-3
- There is just a couple of men in the whole base. The other buildings, as far as I can tell, are controlled by computer.
$ D3b-JMM-3
- [$remote control was developed in previous mission: alt a1] By computer? We thought this remote control gives us edge... it didn't last long.
$ D3b-JMM-3a
- [otherwise: alt a2] By computer? Damn, the Russians technologies are so ahead of us.

// Dialogue 3a (some 20 minutes later; if the warehouse still stands)
$ D3a-Har-1
- John, do you read me? Complete your task and return immediately. This is urgent. Do you read me?

// Dialogue 3b (ditto, if the warehouse is destroyed)
$ D3b-Har-1
- John, do you read me? Return immediately. This is urgent. Do you read me?

# M2
Add Main return
- Return immediately to North edge of map
#

// Dialogue 3b (one or two of the following lines is used, depending on who is actually present in mission)
$ D3b-Lisa-1
- Here we go again, the officers shit their pants and we have to leave the job half done.
$ D3b-Bobby-1
- Just when we're starting to hurt the bastards!
$ D3b-Cyrus-1
- There's something wrong here. We've got to get out.
$ D3b-Frank-1
- If you want us to finish what we've started, I'm happy to stick around.
$ D3b-Kha-1
- Allah is with us. Let us take our revenge against the Russian demons. They must not go unpunished.
$ D3b-Yam-1
- We can't leave now, they are about to crumple.

// Dialogue 4 (some 10 minutes later, if John didn't come back)
$ D4-Har-1
- John! We need you here now. This is an order. Return now!

# M3
Chg return
- Return to the North edge of map in three minutes
#

// Dialogue 5 (when attacks hill??? with the warehouse)
$ D5-JMM-1
- Damn, retreat. There are more turrets than we can handle.
$ D5-Lisa-1
- [present] Shit, they've got such fucking firepower.
$ D5-JMM-2
- Something must be powering those turrets.
$ D5-Frank-2
- [present: alt a1] If I wanted to piss the attackers off, I'd build a main power line ??? between those turrets.
$ D5-Yam-2
- [present: alt a2] I think the main power line is among those turrets.
$ D5-Sol1-2
- [Yamoko dead or Frank dead: alt a3] Can't the main power line be among those turrets?
$ D5-JMM-3
- But they've got to produce that power somewhere. Is there anything that looks like a Russian power plant?
$ D5-Cyrus-3
- [present] I'd destroy everything to be on the safe side. I don't want to ponder the function of every fucking building.

// Query 1 (when Macmillan reaches north area, warehouse is destroyed and some people are too far)
? Q1
Some of your people did not make it here yet. What do you want to do?
- Wait for them
- Return to Gamma without them
?

// Dialogue 6 (at end of the mission - this is last dialogue of JMM and Harrison before Harrison's death)
$ D6-JMM-1
- Macmillan to base. Objective achieved, we are returning.
$ D6-Har-1
- (over radio) John, everything is in stake. We underestimated their strength. They beaten off the mercenaries and they are attacking us. Gamma will not last for long and I can't spare anybody from Alpha. You have to return quickly and help Gamma out. If it falls, nothing is going to stop Russians from wiping us out.
$ D6-JMM-2
- I understand, Ron.
$ D6-Har-2
- (over radio, warmly). I trust you John. You have my trust more than anybody else.
$ D6-JMM-3
- I will not disappoint you.
